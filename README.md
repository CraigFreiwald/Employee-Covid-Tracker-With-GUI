# CovidEmployeeTracker
This is a Java Ant application using the Model View Controller (MVC) design architecture. This application was a project for a class at Penn State Univeristy.

Its purpose is to be used to track employee information regarding Covid-19, and it uses object serialization to provide persistent memory of user accounts, employee objects, and to provide login security. Tracked employee information can also be generated to a CSV file upon request. This information includes Employee Names, Dates of Birth, Department, Vaccine Dates, Quarantine Dates/Current Status, and total days spent in quarantine.
